# Trinidad

Trinidad allows you to run Rails or Rack applications within an embedded 
Apache Tomcat container.

* Bug Tracker: http://github.com/trinidad/trinidad/issues
* IRC Channel (on FreeNode): #trinidad

## Installation

```
$ jruby -S gem install trinidad
```

## Quick Start

```
$ cd myapp
$ jruby -S trinidad
```

### Setup

If you use Bundler, you might want to add Trinidad to your *Gemfile*:

```
gem 'trinidad', :require => nil
```

**Rails**

If you have Trinidad in your *Gemfile* you can start it with `rails server`:

```
$ rails s trinidad
```

or simply, if you prefer not to use the Rack handler, use:

```
$ trinidad
```

**Sinatra**

```
$ ruby app.rb -s Trinidad
```

or configure your application to always use Trinidad:

```ruby
require 'sinatra'
require 'trinidad'

configure do
  set :server, :trinidad
end
```

**Rackup**

You can pass the server name as an option to `rackup`:

```
$ rackup -s trinidad
```

Or you can set Trinidad by default in your `config.ru` file:

```
#\ -s trinidad
```

We do recommend to use the plain `trinidad` command for running applications 
(in production), since it supports runtime pooling while the rackup mode does
not, it also provides you with better Java integration possibilities.

Also note that Trinidad does not mimic JRuby-Rack's behavior of starting a pool
for Rails but booting plain Rack applications in a thread-safe manner  by 
default (this is due backwards compatibility). Currently, runtime pooling is the 
default with Trinidad and stays the same no matter the type of the application
you're running. We expect this default to most likely change in future versions
of Trinidad as thread-safe gets more adopted by the release of Rails 4.0.

## Configuration

Trinidad allows you to configure parameters from the command line, the following 
is a list of the currently supported options (try `trinidad -h`):

```
  * -d, --dir ROOT_DIR            =>  web application root directory
  * -e, --env ENVIRONMENT         =>  rack (rails) environment
  * --rackup [RACKUP_FILE]        =>  rackup configuration file
  * --public PUBLIC_DIR           =>  web application public root
  * -c, --context CONTEXT         =>  application context path
  * --monitor MONITOR_FILE        =>  monitor for application re-deploys
  * -t, --threadsafe              =>  force thread-safe mode (use single runtime)
  * --runtimes MIN:MAX            =>  use given number of min/max jruby runtimes
  * -f, --config [CONFIG_FILE]    =>  configuration file
  * --address ADDRESS             =>  host address
  * -p, --port PORT               =>  port to bind to
  * -s, --ssl [SSL_PORT]          =>  enable secure socket layout
  * -a, --ajp [AJP_PORT]          =>  enable the AJP web protocol
  * --java_lib LIB_DIR            =>  contains .jar files used by the app
  * --java_classes CLASSES_DIR    =>  contains java classes used by the app
  * -l, --load EXTENSION_NAMES    =>  load options for extensions
  * --apps_base APPS_BASE_DIR     =>  set applications base directory
  * -g, --log LEVEL               =>  set logging level
```

You can also specify a default *web.xml* to configure your web application. 
By default the server tries to load the file *config/web.xml* but you can change
the path by adding the option `default_web_xml` within your configuration file.

### YAML Configuration

The server can also be configured from a .yml file. By default, if a file is 
not specified, the server tries to load *config/trinidad.yml*.
Within this file you can specify options available on the command line and tune 
server settings or configure multiple applications to be hosted on the server.

Advanced configuration options are explained in the wiki: 
http://wiki.github.com/trinidad/trinidad/advanced-configuration


```
$ jruby -S trinidad --config my_trinidad.yml
```

```yml
---
  port: 4242
  address: 0.0.0.0
```

### Ruby Configuration

As an alternative to the *config/trinidad.yml* file, a .rb configuration file 
might be used to setup Trinidad. It follows the same convention as the yaml 
configuration - the file `config/trinidad.rb` is loaded by default if exists.

```ruby
Trinidad.configure do |config|
  config.port = 4242
  config.address = '0.0.0.0'
  #config[:custom] = 'custom'
end
```

### Logging

As you might notice on your first `trinidad` the server uses standard output :

```
kares@theborg:~/workspace/trinidad/MegaUpload$ trinidad -p 8000 -e staging
Initializing ProtocolHandler ["http-bio-8000"]
Starting Servlet Engine: Apache Tomcat/7.0.28
Starting ProtocolHandler ["http-bio-8000"]
Context with name [/] has started rolling
Context with name [/] has completed rolling
```

It also prints warnings and error messages on error output, while application 
specific log messages (e.g. logs from `Rails.logger`) always go into the expected
file location at *log/{environment}.log*. 

Application logging performs daily file rolling out of the box and only prints 
messages to the console while it runs in development mode, that means you won't
see any application specific output on the console say in production !

Please note that these logging details as well as the logging format will be 
configurable with *trinidad.yml/.rb* within the next **1.4.x** release.

If you plan to use a slice of Java with your JRuby and require a logger, consider 
using `ServletContext#log`. By default it is setup in a way that logging with 
`ServletContext` ends up in the same location as the Rails log. 
If this is not enough you can still configure a Java logging library e.g. SLF4J,
just make sure you tell Trinidad to use it as well, if needed, using the 
**jruby.rack.logging** context parameter in *web.xml*.

### Context Configuration

For slightly advanced (and "dirty" XML :)) application configuration Trinidad 
also supports the exact same *context.xml* format as Tomcat. Each web app is 
represented as a context instance and might be configured as such. You do not 
need to repeat configuring the same parameters you have already setup with the 
Trinidad configuration. This is meant to be mostly for those familiar with 
Tomcat internals.
Currently the application's *context.xml* is expected to be located on the 
class-path under your *[classes]/META-INF* directory.

Context Doc: http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/config/context.html

### Serving Assets

Trinidad uses Tomcat's built-in capabilities to server your public files. 
We do recommend compiling assets up front and disabling the asset server (in 
production) if you're using the asset pipeline in a Rails application.
If you do not put a web-server such as Apache in front of Trinidad you might
want to configure the resource caching (on by default for env != development)
for maximum performance e.g. by default it's configured as follows :

```yml
---
  public: 
    root: public # same as the above "public: public" setting
    cached: true # enable (in-memory) asset caching on for env != 'development'
    cache_ttl: 5000 # cache TTL in millis (might want to increase this)
    cache_max_size: 10240 # the maximum cache size in kB
    cache_object_max_size: 512 # max size for a cached object (asset) in kB
    #aliases: # allows to "link" other directories into the public root e.g. :
      #/home: /var/local/www
```

Note that this configuration applies to (server-side) resource caching on top 
of the "public" file-system. You do not need to worry about client side caching, 
it is handled out of the box with *ETag* and *Last-Modified* headers being set.

You might also "mount" file-system directories as aliases to your resources
root to be served by your application (as if they were in the public folder).

**NOTE:** In development mode if you ever happen to `rake assets:precompile` 
make sure to remove your *public/assets* directory later, otherwise requests
such as **/assets/application.js?body=1.0** might not hit the Rails runtime.

## Hot Deployment

Trinidad supports monitoring a file to reload applications, when the file 
*tmp/restart.txt* is updated (e.g. `touch tmp/restart.txt`), the server reloads 
the application the monitor file belongs to. 
This monitor file can be customized with the `monitor` configuration option.

Since version **1.4.0** Trinidad supports 2 reload strategies :

* **restart** (default) synchronous reloading (exposed by Tomcat). This strategy
  pauses incoming requests while it reloads the application and then serves them
  once ready (or timeouts if it takes too long). It has been chosen as the default
  strategy since **1.4.0** due it's more predictable memory requirements.

* **rolling** "zero-downtime" (asynchronous) reloading strategy similar to 
  Passenger's rolling reloads. This has been the default since **1.1.0** up till
  the **1.3.x** line. If you use this you should account that your JVM memory
  requirements might increase quite a lot (esp. if you reload under heavy loads)
  since requests are being served while there's another version of the
  application being loaded.

Configure the reload strategy per web application or globally e.g. :

```yml
---
  port: 8080
  environment: production
  reload_strategy: rolling
```

## Virtual Hosts

It's possible to use Trinidad with multiple hosts and load the applications under 
them automatically. Please remember that each host must have its applications in 
a different directory.

```ruby
Trinidad.configure do |config|
  config.hosts = {
    # applications_path => host_name_list 
    # (first one is the real host name, the other ones are aliases)
    'app_local' => ['localhost', '127.0.0.1'],
    'apps_lol'  => ['lolhost', 'lol'],
    'apps_foo'  => 'foo'
  }
end
```

If applications are configured via the `web_apps` section, the host for each app
can be added with the `hosts` key under each application. 
If several applications belong to the same host put them under the same directory
and specify the name of the host for each one e.g. :

```ruby
Trinidad.configure do |config|
  config.web_apps = {
    :mock1 => {
      :web_app_dir => 'rails_apps/mock1',
      :hosts       => ['rails.virtual.host', 'rails.host']
    },
    :mock2 => {
      :web_app_dir => 'rails_apps/mock2',
      :hosts       => 'rails.virtual.host'
    },
    :mock3 => {
      :web_app_dir => 'rack_apps/mock3',
      :hosts       => ['rack.virtual.host', 'rack.host']
    }
  }
end
```
