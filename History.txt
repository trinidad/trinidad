== Trinidad_jars 1.2.0 (2013-01-14)

* Tomcat 7.0.33 http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/changelog.html
* patched JULI's DirectJDKLog to not generate stack traces for every log
  by default (can be turned back using org.apache.juli.logging.logSource=true)
* native (Java) implementations for logging classes, to keep logging AFAP

== Trinidad 1.4.4 (2012-10-19)

* make sure setting FileHandler's rotatable to false works (#82)
* first draft for web-app logging configuration to avoid use hacks e.g. 
  for disabling rotation (this feature is not yet official and might change)
* fix new lines (ala default Rails.logger) in console output
* set correct (JRuby-Rack) layout for web apps and use app.root 
  (besides rails.root)
* check whether (jruby.) params are specified in system properties (#92)
* fix JUL::ConsoleHandler - not setting up JRuby streams correctly (#88)

== Trinidad_jars 1.1.1 (2012-10-17)

* Tomcat 7.0.32 http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/changelog.html
* avoid using the "global" (and redundant) TRINIDAD_LIBS constant
* load the .jar files instead of requiring them (no more $: polution)

== Trinidad 1.4.3 (2012-09-20)

* allow to keep (and configure) the jsp servlet (support for serving .jsp pages)
* decreased jruby.runtime.acquire.timeout default from 10 to 5 seconds
* removed Threads=MIN:MAX option from Rack::Handler (makes no sense right now)
* trinidad (CLI) :
  - added --runtimes option to allow specifying pool size on command-line
  - deprecated libs_dir and classes_dir added java_lib and java_classes
  - deprecated --apps option and use the same name as in config --apps_base
  - now prints some more accurate defaults that are used
* leverage Tomcat's default servlet for serving static asset files :
  - use a customized default servlet to handle the public.root assets
  - support for providing aliases (to achieve desired backward compatibility)
  - support for allowing caching and tuning (asset) cache parameters
* allow absolute paths with :default_web_xml / :web_xml configuration option
* replace :libs_dir and :classes_dir with :java_lib and :java_classes options 
  (backwards compatible) with sensible defaults *lib/java* and *lib/java/classes*
* make sure application :work_dir is actually being set on the context
  and change it by default to to [RAILS_ROOT]/tmp 
* web application's :web_app_dir deprecated in favor of the :root_dir option
* make sure the rack servlet loads on startup by default
* allow init_params: to be configured with (rack/default) servlet options
* allow for default (servlet) overrides using default_servlet:
* better rack_servlet: configuration
  - accepts a servlet instance (and assumes it is configured)
  - 'rack' naming convention might be used to use custom servlet class
  - support for servlet :mapping and :load_on_startup options
* fix async_supported: option not propagating correctly into servlet
* support for loading META-INF/context.xml from the (classes) class-path

Requires JRuby-Rack >= 1.1.10 and thus includes the following features :

 - Rails 3.1+ `render stream: true` support with HTTP chunked encoding
 - initial compatibility with Rails master (getting torwards 4.0.0.beta)
 - all Rack applications now support pooling runtimes (not just Rails)
 - better and more predictable application pool initialization
 - support for fully leveraging the Servlet API for parameters/cookies
   this is useful for Java integration cases when a servlet/filter consumes
   the input stream before Rails (e.g. valves such as AccessLogValve).
   it is an experimental feature that might change in the future and 
   currently requires setting 'jruby.rack.handler.env' param to 'servlet'

== Trinidad_jars 1.1.0 (2012-09-20)

* include java code compiled into trinidad-rb.jar for Trinidad
* otherwise same as previous version (1.0.7) uses Tomcat 7.0.30

== Trinidad 1.4.1 (2012-08-17)

* make sure file logging rotates correctly when file handler attempts rolling 
  after midnight (#81)
* refined (backwards-compatible) extension API 
  - options attr reader 
  - override_tomcat? no longer needed simply return a tomcat duck 
  - expose camelize + symbolize helpers
  - WebAppExtension should only get a single context argument on configure
* better rails (2.3/3.x) detection with environment.rb
* minor server updates 
  - expose configured web_apps 
  - add a trap? helper (for easier overrides) 
  - introduce a stop! for stopping and destroying a the server

== Trinidad 1.4.0 (2012-07-24)

* fix incorrect context-param parsing and only configure logging when 
  deployment descriptor did not specified jruby.rack.logging param (#76)
* deep symbolize_options should account for arrays of hashes (#80)
* requires latest Tomcat 7.0.28 (jars 1.0.5) due context reloading fix
* requires latest jruby-rack 1.1.7 due delegating RackLogger to JUL
* Trinidad::WebApp API revisited some changes are non-backwards compatible !
* enable running multiple applications with different ruby versions (using the 
  jruby_compat_version configuration option)
* allow arbitrary keys to be stored with Trinidad::Configuration
* changed Trinidad::Lifecycle::Base to be a (ruby-like) base lifecycle listener
  skeleton implementation, thus removed all web app specifics from the class
  (include Trinidad::Lifecycle::WebApp::Shared to gain the same functionality)
* removed unused Trinidad::Rack module and KeyTool from Trinidad::Tomcat
* reinvented server/application logging with Trinidad::Logging :
  - refactored Trinidad's global logging configuration with JUL
  - application logs into log/env.log by default with daily rolling
  - console logs are now less chatty and only print logs from applications 
    running in development mode (configuration to come in a later release)
  - make sure Trinidad's custom log formatter prints thrown exceptions
  - use local timestamps with (file) log formatter by default
* Trinidad::Server#add_web_app for code re-use during rolling redeploys
* refactored application (monitor based `touch 'tmp/restart.txt'`) reloading
  - bring back synchronous context reloading and make it default
  - "zero downtime" async rolling reload is still supported and configurable via 
    the reload_strategy: rolling configuration option
  - updated the context restart code - hot deploys should now work reliably (#75)
  - moved Trinidad::Lifecycle::Host under Trinidad::Lifecycle::WebApp::Host
  - Trinidad::Lifecycle::Host now accepts a server instance instead of a tomcat
  - introduced Trinidad::WebApp::Holder to be used instead of bare Hash
* add async_supported attribute for servlet (3.0) configuration
